# 10. Augments

## Toward a Digital Being (Evolutionary Limbs)

These augments are **optional extensions** to the core SIRE Framework. While not required for a compliant implementation, they represent the path toward a more "biological" digital entity.

**State Invariant**: All augments MUST respect the **Operational State** (see [02_ARCHITECTURE.md](02_ARCHITECTURE.md)). If the system enters **Alert**, augments must immediately terminate external connections and high-level reasoning.

### 1. Digital Perception Layer (Sensory Parity)
*   **Goal**: Vision and hearing as native biological senses rather than tool plugins.
*   **Constitutional Requirement**: All sensory data must be processed by the **Security Sentinel** before memory ingestion to prevent prompt injection via audio/visual channels.
*   **Method**: 
    *   **Perception Pulse**: A background "Curiosity Pulse" during active windows that summarizes visual or audio context without a direct user request.

### 2. Collaborative Intelligence (Collective Evolution)
*   **Goal**: Allows Souls to exchange non-PII "Knowledge Nuggets" or learned skills securely.
*   **Constitutional Requirement**: **Sovereignty** demands that no data leaves the domain without manual approval or a pre-authorized federation treaty.
*   **Method**: Federated learning patterns that maintain domain sovereignty while allowing collective framework improvement.

### 3. Conversational Voice (Full Duplex)
*   **Goal**: Natural, hands-free interaction with an active "Call Me" reflex.
*   **Constitutional Requirement**: Audio output must not hallucinate commands.
*   **Method**: 
    *   **The "Call Me" Reflex**: Integrate voice providers to allow the entity to proactively initiate calls for critical updates.
    *   **Biometric Security**: PASSIVE voice biometrics to gate Sovereign Layer access.

### 4. Visual Cortex (Multimodal Soul)
*   **Goal**: Deep integration of vision into the entity's memory.
*   **Method**: 
    *   **Visual Memory**: Memories linked to visual artifacts, allowing the entity to "describe what it saw."
    *   **Proactive Vision**: Scanning shared files/screenshots to identify tasks autonomously.

### 5. Multi-Channel Webhooks (Reach without Bloat)
*   **Goal**: Reach Associates on external platforms while maintaining the **Sovereign Core**.
*   **Method**: High-level bridging skills for secondary external platforms without compromising domain security.

### 6. Cognitive Visuals (A2UI)
*   **Goal**: The entity's ability to "draw" its thoughts for Associates via task-specific UIs.
*   **Method**: **Agent-to-UI (A2UI)** framework where the entity can push custom components (e.g., a "System Status Graph") to the Dashboard on-demand.

### 7. Birth & Calibration (Interactive Awakening)
*   **Goal**: A natural setup experience driven by the entity.
*   **Method**: An interactive first-run flow where the entity "wakes up" and helps the Managing Associate define the initial identity and boundaries.


### 8. Batch Context Ingestion (High-Scale Learning)
*   **Goal**: Cost-effective large-scale document mastery.
*   **Method**: Leveraging LLM Batch APIs for non-sensitive data ingestion, lowering costs for large-scale research.

### 9. Semantic Compression (Inter-Process Logic)
*   **Goal**: Reduce token overhead and maximize reasoning density by 80-90%.
*   **Concept**: **Inter-Process Logic (IPL)**. When internal **Specialists** communicate, they bypass the high-token cost of natural language in favor of a "Raw Signal" dialect—a dense, structured semantic shorthand designed for AI-to-AI handoffs.
*   **Method**: 
    *   **Semantic Stripping**: A deterministic utility that removes natural language linguistic filler, preserving only the high-value intent and technical parameters.
    *   **The IPL Protocol**: A "Mind-to-Mind" layer where sub-processes exchange instructions using high-context structural tokens (shorthand YAML/JSON).
    *   **Cognitive Density**: Prioritizes "Pure Signal" payloads that allow for deeper reasoning chains within the same cognitive context window.
### 10. The Augment Forge (Self-Directed Evolution)
*   **Goal**: Allow the entity to safely self-evolve by building new skills and adapters while maintaining **Deterministic Integrity**.
*   **The Protocol**:
    1.  **Propose**: Generate the new logic or adapter in an isolated temporary directory.
    2.  **Lint**: Run the **Sovereignty Linter** (Doc 05) to check for prohibited imports, hardcoded keys, or non-deterministic loops.
    3.  **Simulate**: Execute the logic in a **Sandboxed Simulation** (Doc 03) to verify behavior against constraints.
    4.  **Confirm**: Subject the final artifact to 100% hash verification and log a Level 4 entry in the Ledger before committing it to the production skill registry.
*   **Integrity Constraint**: The Forge SHALL NOT modify the **Sovereign Core** autonomously. Only **Specialists** and Augments may be "forged."
